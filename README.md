# Keyper Wallet

Hardware wallet security with iPhone experience. Leave your Ledger at home.

## Overview

Keyper Wallet is an open-source iOS cryptocurrency wallet that leverages iPhone's Secure Enclave to provide hardware-grade security without carrying extra devices. Built with pure Swift and zero third-party dependencies.

## The Constitution

Seven immutable principles that define Keyper Wallet:

### 1. Hardware-Grade Security, No Hardware
iPhone Secure Enclave provides chip-level protection. Your private key never leaves the security chip—same security as Ledger, without carrying extra devices.

### 2. 100% Open Source
Every line of code is public and auditable. No hidden logic, no backdoors, no trust required. Verify, don't trust.

### 3. Zero Dependencies
Only Apple native APIs. No third-party libraries. Zero supply chain risk. No npm packages that could be compromised. Pure Swift only.

### 4. User Sovereignty
No custody, no cloud sync, no upload. Your escape route is your own EOA—not dependent on any service. We never touch your keys.

### 5. Minimal Architecture
Only two layers: Secure Enclave for daily use, EOA for escape. No feature bloat, no complexity. More code = more bugs.

### 6. No Compromise
iOS only. Swift native only. We don't chase market share at the cost of security. No Android, no React Native, no cross-platform shortcuts.

### 7. Battle-Tested Contracts
Built on Safe smart contracts (v1.4.1)—the most trusted wallet infrastructure, securing $100B+ in assets since 2018.
